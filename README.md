```text
React UI (Presentation Layer)
       │
   Context / State
       │
Controllers / Application Services
       │
Domain Entities / Services
       │
Repositories (Firestore / API)
       │
Trusted Financial Backend & Firebase SDK
       │
Cloud Firestore (Authoritative Source of Truth)
```

- **Authoritative Database**: Cloud Firestore is the primary single source of truth.
- **Local Storage**: Strictly reserved for temporary setup wizard draft state and client UI preferences.
- **Branch Isolation & RBAC**: Centralized role-based access control and branch verification across server handlers and security rules.

```env
# Server-Side Gemini API Key (Secret - MUST NOT be prefixed with VITE_)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_server_side_gemini_api_key

# Client-Side Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Application Localization
VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=ar
VITE_ENABLE_RTL=true
```

## 6. Firebase & Security Rules

Firestore security rules (`firestore.rules`) enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- **Unauthenticated / Anonymous Access**: Strictly blocked across all sensitive collections.
- **Financial & Payroll Collections** (`employees`, `salaries`, `expenses`, `purchases`, `bank_transactions`, `accounts`, `revenues`): Restricted to `Owner`, `Admin`, `Manager`, and `Accountant` roles.
- **Server-Authoritative Financial Ledger Operations**: Sensitive financial ledger writes execute via trusted server backend endpoints (`/api/*`).

Deploy Security Rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
```
